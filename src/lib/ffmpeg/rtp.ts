/**
 * RTP and RTCP packet demultiplexer and UDP port management for FFmpeg-based HomeKit livestreaming.
 *
 * This module supplies classes and helpers to support realtime streaming via FFmpeg in Homebridge and similar HomeKit environments. It enables the
 * demultiplexing of RTP and RTCP packets on a single UDP port, as required by HomeKit and RFC 5761, working around FFmpeg's lack of native support for RTP/RTCP
 * multiplexing. It also manages the allocation and tracking of UDP ports for RTP and RTCP, helping prevent conflicts in dynamic, multi-session streaming
 * scenarios.
 *
 * Key features:
 *
 * - Demultiplexes RTP and RTCP packets received on a single UDP port, forwarding them to the correct FFmpeg destinations for HomeKit livestream compatibility.
 * - Injects periodic heartbeat messages to keep two-way audio streams alive with FFmpeg's strict timeout requirements.
 * - Dynamically allocates and reserves UDP ports for RTP/RTCP, supporting consecutive port pairing for correct FFmpeg operation.
 * - Event-driven architecture for integration with plugin or automation logic.
 *
 * Designed for plugin developers and advanced users implementing HomeKit livestreaming, audio/video bridging, or similar applications requiring precise
 * RTP/RTCP handling with FFmpeg.

 * FFmpeg does not support multiplexing RTP and RTCP data on a single UDP port (RFC 5761) and HomeKit requires this for livestreaming. This class listens on a
 * UDP port and demultiplexes RTP and RTCP traffic, forwarding them to separate RTP and RTCP ports as required by FFmpeg.
